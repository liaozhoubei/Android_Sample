/**
 * Lazy loading list that pages in immutable content from a {@link DataSource}.
 * <p>
 * A PagedList is a {@link List} which loads its data in chunks (pages) from a {@link DataSource}.
 * Items can be accessed with {@link #get(int)}, and further loading can be triggered with
 * {@link #loadAround(int)}. To display a PagedList, see {@link PagedListAdapter}, which enables the
 * binding of a PagedList to a {@link androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView}.
 * <h4>Loading Data</h4>
 * <p>
 * All data in a PagedList is loaded from its {@link DataSource}. Creating a PagedList loads the
 * first chunk of data from the DataSource immediately, and should for this reason be done on a
 * background thread. The constructed PagedList may then be passed to and used on the UI thread.
 * This is done to prevent passing a list with no loaded content to the UI thread, which should
 * generally not be presented to the user.
 * <p>
 * A PagedList initially presents this first partial load as its content, and expands over time as
 * content is loaded in. When {@link #loadAround} is called, items will be loaded in near the passed
 * list index. If placeholder {@code null}s are present in the list, they will be replaced as
 * content is loaded. If not, newly loaded items will be inserted at the beginning or end of the
 * list.
 * <p>
 * PagedList can present data for an unbounded, infinite scrolling list, or a very large but
 * countable list. Use {@link Config} to control how many items a PagedList loads, and when.
 * <p>
 * If you use {@link LivePagedListBuilder} to get a
 * {@link androidx.lifecycle.LiveData}&lt;PagedList>, it will initialize PagedLists on a
 * background thread for you.
 * <h4>Placeholders</h4>
 * <p>
 * There are two ways that PagedList can represent its not-yet-loaded data - with or without
 * {@code null} placeholders.
 * <p>
 * With placeholders, the PagedList is always the full size of the data set. {@code get(N)} returns
 * the {@code N}th item in the data set, or {@code null} if its not yet loaded.
 * <p>
 * Without {@code null} placeholders, the PagedList is the sublist of data that has already been
 * loaded. The size of the PagedList is the number of currently loaded items, and {@code get(N)}
 * returns the {@code N}th <em>loaded</em> item. This is not necessarily the {@code N}th item in the
 * data set.
 * <p>
 * Placeholders have several benefits:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>They express the full sized list to the presentation layer (often a
 *     {@link PagedListAdapter}), and so can support scrollbars (without jumping as pages are
 *     loaded or dropped) and fast-scrolling to any position, loaded or not.
 *     <li>They avoid the need for a loading spinner at the end of the loaded list, since the list
 *     is always full sized.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * They also have drawbacks:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Your Adapter needs to account for {@code null} items. This often means providing default
 *     values in data you bind to a {@link androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder}.
 *     <li>They don't work well if your item views are of different sizes, as this will prevent
 *     loading items from cross-fading nicely.
 *     <li>They require you to count your data set, which can be expensive or impossible, depending
 *     on your DataSource.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Placeholders are enabled by default, but can be disabled in two ways. They are disabled if the
 * DataSource does not count its data set in its initial load, or if  {@code false} is passed to
 * {@link Config.Builder#setEnablePlaceholders(boolean)} when building a {@link Config}.
 * <h4>Mutability and Snapshots</h4>
 * A PagedList is <em>mutable</em> while loading, or ready to load from its DataSource.
 * As loads succeed, a mutable PagedList will be updated via Runnables on the main thread. You can
 * listen to these updates with a {@link Callback}. (Note that {@link PagedListAdapter} will listen
 * to these to signal RecyclerView about the updates/changes).
 * <p>
 * If a PagedList attempts to load from an invalid DataSource, it will {@link #detach()}
 * from the DataSource, meaning that it will no longer attempt to load data. It will return true
 * from {@link #isImmutable()}, and a new DataSource / PagedList pair must be created to load
 * further data. See {@link DataSource} and {@link LivePagedListBuilder} for how new PagedLists are
 * created to represent changed data.
 * <p>
 * A PagedList snapshot is simply an immutable shallow copy of the current state of the PagedList as
 * a {@code List}. It will reference the same inner items, and contain the same {@code null}
 * placeholders, if present.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the entries in the list.

    /**
     * Signals when a PagedList has reached the end of available data.
     * <p>
     * When local storage is a cache of network data, it's common to set up a streaming pipeline:
     * Network data is paged into the database, database is paged into UI. Paging from the database
     * to UI can be done with a {@code LiveData<PagedList>}, but it's still necessary to know when
     * to trigger network loads.
     * <p>
     * BoundaryCallback does this signaling - when a DataSource runs out of data at the end of
     * the list, {@link #onItemAtEndLoaded(Object)} is called, and you can start an async network
     * load that will write the result directly to the database. Because the database is being
     * observed, the UI bound to the {@code LiveData<PagedList>} will update automatically to
     * account for the new items.
     * <p>
     * Note that a BoundaryCallback instance shared across multiple PagedLists (e.g. when passed to
     * {@link LivePagedListBuilder#setBoundaryCallback}), the callbacks may be issued multiple
     * times. If for example {@link #onItemAtEndLoaded(Object)} triggers a network load, it should
     * avoid triggering it again while the load is ongoing.
     * <p>
     * The database + network Repository in the
     * <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/PagingWithNetworkSample/README.md">PagingWithNetworkSample</a>
     * shows how to implement a network BoundaryCallback using
     * <a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a>, while
     * handling swipe-to-refresh, network errors, and retry.
     * <h4>Requesting Network Data</h4>
     * BoundaryCallback only passes the item at front or end of the list when out of data. This
     * makes it an easy fit for item-keyed network requests, where you can use the item passed to
     * the BoundaryCallback to request more data from the network. In these cases, the source of
     * truth for next page to load is coming from local storage, based on what's already loaded.
     * <p>
     * If you aren't using an item-keyed network API, you may be using page-keyed, or page-indexed.
     * If this is the case, the paging library doesn't know about the page key or index used in the
     * BoundaryCallback, so you need to track it yourself. You can do this in one of two ways:
     * <h5>Local storage Page key</h5>
     * If you want to perfectly resume your query, even if the app is killed and resumed, you can
     * store the key on disk. Note that with a positional/page index network API, there's a simple
     * way to do this, by using the {@code listSize} as an input to the next load (or
     * {@code listSize / NETWORK_PAGE_SIZE}, for page indexing).
     * <p>
     * The current list size isn't passed to the BoundaryCallback though. This is because the
     * PagedList doesn't necessarily know the number of items in local storage. Placeholders may be
     * disabled, or the DataSource may not count total number of items.
     * <p>
     * Instead, for these positional cases, you can query the database for the number of items, and
     * pass that to the network.
     * <h5>In-Memory Page key</h5>
     * Often it doesn't make sense to query the next page from network if the last page you fetched
     * was loaded many hours or days before. If you keep the key in memory, you can refresh any time
     * you start paging from a network source.
     * <p>
     * Store the next key in memory, inside your BoundaryCallback. When you create a new
     * BoundaryCallback when creating a new {@code LiveData}/{@code Observable} of
     * {@code PagedList}, refresh data. For example,
     * <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-paging/index.html#8">in the
     * Paging Codelab</a>, the GitHub network page index is stored in memory.
